# FraudFlag: Advanced Transaction Anomaly Detection System

**A cloud-native fraud detection platform for identifying suspicious payment patterns and erroneous transactions in public sector financial systems.**

Developed by **Aseela Ali**, PhD Researcher in Cloud Computing, this solution demonstrates advanced anomaly detection capabilities applicable to UK Government and local authority payment systems for benefit fraud investigation.

---

## System Overview

FraudFlag implements a multi-layered anomaly detection framework designed to identify:
- **Statistical outliers** in transaction amounts and frequencies
- **Behavioral anomalies** in payment patterns
- **Temporal irregularities** indicating potential fraud or system errors
- **Network-based suspicious activities** through relationship analysis

The platform utilizes machine learning algorithms specifically tuned for financial fraud detection in public sector environments.
